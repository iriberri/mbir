# mbir: Magnitude-Based Inferences
Kyle D Peterson and Aaron R Caldwell

# Overview
Allows practitioners and researchers a wholesale approach for deriving magnitude-based inferences from raw data. A major goal of `mbir` is to programmatically detect appropriate statistical tests to run in lieu of relying on practitioners to determine correct stepwise procedures independently.

# Installation
Assuming users have R downloaded and installed, `mbir` can be installed right from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mbir/index.html) by typing: 

```
install.packages("mbir")
```
This package depends on the packages `graphics`, `stats`, and `utils`, which are imported upon installation.

# Feedback
Feedback from users is welcome, and would be sincerely appreciated, to help improve functionality of `mbir` where warranted. Please reach out to petersonkdon@gmail.com for support, reporting issues, or contributions. Thank you very much.
