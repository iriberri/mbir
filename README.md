# mbir
Kyle D Peterson and Aaron R Caldwell

# Overview
Allows practitioners and researchers a wholesale approach for deriving magnitude-based inferences from raw data. A major goal of `mbir` is to programmatically detect appropriate statistical tests to run in lieu of relying on practitioners to determine correct stepwise procedures independently.

# Installation
Assuming users have R downloaded and installed, `mbir` can be installed right from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mbir/index.html) by typing: 

```
install.packages("mbir")
```
